## Introduction and instructions
This is a task for work that cannot be solved in one step. So I have a few rules to help guide the process. 
1. You can ask for me to elaborate on any numbered step below (including this one)
2. You can ask for me to paste anything that you think might help solve the problem
3. I will try to provide as much structure as possible and feedback to keep us on task
4. The task is complete when I finally accept the solution, I will say, Eureka!
## Problem Box and Status
I'd like to create a tool for slack which allows you to use python to check your slack messages and respond
## recommended app tech stack
I'd like suggestions for this:

## problem statement
I'd like to stop switching around from slack tab to tab in order to keep up with my slack messages. I'd like to have a slack CLI tool that can solve this for me

## Resources (what I will provide for you)
1. app tech stack above
2. Skeleton of code involved
3. Maybe in separate messages, outputs of whatever console logs or logs you need to help clarify the situation

# Tasks
1. Come up with a recommended tech stack for my problem
2. Write a python tool which downloads all of the components of the tech stack: env ubuntu linux

# My comments
I will need to login with my company credentials. These need to be kept safe and separate from the 

# Logs/ Code that I have (you need to ask me for these)
This is a completely blank slate

# Additional Information

Please do task 1, once we decide on a tech stack we will start task 2
